# This .gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files and directories
# that Git should ignore. It helps keep the repository clean and focused on
# source code, while excluding build artifacts, temporary files, and sensitive data.

# --- Node.js and npm related files ---
# Excludes the node_modules directory, which contains all project dependencies.
# These are typically installed via `npm install` and should not be version controlled.

# Excludes npm debug logs, which are generated during npm operations.
# Covered by *.log below, but kept explicit for clarity if desired.
npm-debug.log*
# Excludes npm cache directory, which stores cached package data.
.npm/
# Excludes Node.js REPL history file.
.node_repl_history

# --- Build and Distribution Directories ---
# Excludes directories where compiled or bundled assets are placed.
# These are generated during the build process and should not be committed.

# As per the project requirements, certain marketing assets or their generated versions
# might not need to be version controlled, especially if they are large or
# generated from source files.
# Excludes large raw image files if only optimized versions are committed.
images/raw/
# Excludes generated image variants (e.g., responsive images generated by a build process).
images/generated/
# Allows optimized images to be tracked if they are in a specific sub-directory.
# Uncomment the line below if you have an 'optimized' subfolder within 'images' that you want to track.
# !images/optimized/
# Excludes temporary or working files from design tools.

# --- Package Manager Lock Files ---
# IMPORTANT: These files (package-lock.json, yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml)
# should generally NOT be ignored as they ensure reproducible builds across environments.
# They are intentionally NOT included in this .gitignore to ensure they are tracked.
# package-lock.json
# yarn.lock
# pnpm-lock.yaml
