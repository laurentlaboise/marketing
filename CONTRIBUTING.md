Contributing to Words That Sells Website
We welcome contributions from everyone! Whether you're a seasoned developer, a budding enthusiast, or simply a user with a great idea, your input helps make the Words That Sells website better. This document outlines the guidelines for contributing to ensure a smooth and collaborative process.

ðŸŒŸ Our Contribution Philosophy
At Words That Sells, we believe in:

Collaboration: Working together to build a robust and high-quality platform.

Quality: Adhering to high standards for code, documentation, and user experience.

Innovation: Embracing new ideas and technologies to enhance our AI-powered marketing solutions.

Clarity: Ensuring all contributions are well-documented and easy to understand.

ðŸš€ Getting Started
To contribute to the Words That Sells website, follow these steps:

1. Project Setup
Fork the Repository:
Navigate to the Words That Sells GitHub repository and click the "Fork" button. This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

Clone Your Fork:
Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/wordsthatsells.website.git
cd wordsthatsells.website

Install Dependencies:
Our project uses Node.js and npm for dependency management. Ensure you have Node.js (v18+) and npm (v9+) installed.

npm install

This command will install all necessary project and development dependencies defined in package.json.

Set Up Git Remotes:
Add the original Words That Sells repository as an "upstream" remote:

git remote add upstream https://github.com/wordsthatsells/website.git

You can verify your remotes with git remote -v.

Launch Development Server:
To start the local development server with hot-reloading:

npm start

This will typically open the site in your browser at http://localhost:3000 (or similar).

2. Code Style Guidelines
We maintain a consistent code style across the project using automated tools.

ESLint (.eslintrc):
Our JavaScript code adheres to strict quality and style rules defined in .eslintrc. This includes rules for ES6+ syntax, accessibility (eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y), performance, and JSDoc comments.

To lint your code manually: npm run lint

ESLint is integrated into our pre-commit hooks to ensure compliance.

Prettier (.prettierrc):
We use Prettier for automated code formatting across HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, and Markdown files. It ensures consistent indentation (2 spaces), single quotes, trailing commas (all), and a line length of 100 characters.

To format your code manually: npm run format

Prettier is also integrated into our pre-commit hooks.

EditorConfig (.editorconfig):
For cross-editor consistency, we use .editorconfig to define basic formatting rules like UTF-8 encoding, LF line endings, and 2-space indentation. Most modern IDEs and editors have built-in support or plugins for EditorConfig.

3. Git Workflow
We follow a feature branch workflow for all contributions.

Create a Feature Branch:
Always create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:

git checkout main
git pull upstream main # Sync with the latest upstream main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name # For new features
# OR
git checkout -b bugfix/issue-description # For bug fixes

Commit Message Format:
We use a conventional commit message format to ensure a clear and readable Git history.

Format: <type>(<scope>): <subject>

Types: feat (new feature), fix (bug fix), docs (documentation), style (code style, no functional changes), refactor (code refactoring), test (adding tests), chore (build process, auxiliary tools, libraries).

Scope (Optional): The part of the codebase affected (e.g., header, auth, 404-page, sitemap).

Subject: A brief, imperative description (max 50 chars).

Body (Optional): More detailed explanation.

Footer (Optional): References to issues (e.g., Closes #123).

Good Examples:

feat(homepage): add AI-powered growth section
fix(404): correct search input placeholder color
docs(contributing): update git workflow section

Bad Examples:

fixed bug
updates
Added new feature for users

Push Your Branch:

git push origin feature/your-feature-name

Create a Pull Request (PR):

Go to your forked repository on GitHub and click "Compare & pull request".

Title: Use the conventional commit format (e.g., feat(services): implement AI copywriting section).

Description:

What does this PR do? (Brief summary)

Why is this change necessary? (Context, problem it solves)

How was it tested? (Steps to reproduce, test results)

Screenshots (if UI changes):

Related Issues: (e.g., Closes #123, Fixes #456)

Request a review from a maintainer.

Responding to Reviews:

Address all reviewer comments promptly, explaining changes or justifying decisions.

Resolve merge conflicts by rebasing your branch:

git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
git push --force-with-lease # Use with caution, only on your feature branch

Request re-review after addressing feedback.

4. Testing Requirements
All contributions must be thoroughly tested to ensure stability and prevent regressions.

Unit Tests:

For JavaScript logic, create unit tests using Jest.

Tests should cover all new functions, components, and critical logic.

Run unit tests: npm test

Integration Tests:

For end-to-end user flows and component interactions, use Cypress.

Ensure new features integrate seamlessly with existing parts of the application.

Setup: If Cypress is not yet installed or configured in your local environment:

npm install cypress --save-dev
npx cypress install # Installs Cypress binaries
npx cypress open   # Opens the Cypress Test Runner

Run integration tests: npm run cypress:open (interactive) or npm run cypress:run (headless).

Manual Testing Checklist:
Before submitting a PR, ensure you have manually checked the following:

[ ] Responsiveness: Test on various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

[ ] Cross-Browser Compatibility: Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari (and Edge if applicable).

[ ] Functionality: All new features work as expected.

[ ] Accessibility: Keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, color contrast (use browser dev tools).

[ ] Performance: No noticeable slowdowns, especially for UI changes. (See Performance Testing below).

[ ] Error Handling: Test edge cases and invalid inputs.

[ ] Console Errors: Check browser console for any errors or warnings.

Performance Testing:

Use Lighthouse (built into Chrome DevTools) to ensure scores >90 for Performance, Accessibility, and SEO for new or modified pages.

Check Core Web Vitals (Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) <2.5s, First Input Delay (FID) <100ms, Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) <0.1).

Include Lighthouse reports (screenshots or JSON) in PRs for UI changes or performance-critical features.

5. Documentation Standards
Clear and up-to-date documentation is vital for project maintainability.

README Files:

Every major directory (e.g., css/, js/, en/company/about-us/) should have a README.md explaining its purpose, structure, and content management guidelines.

Update relevant README.md files when adding new features or changing existing structures.

Code Comments:

Use JSDoc for all JavaScript functions, classes, and complex logic to explain purpose, parameters, and return values.

Add inline comments for complex or non-obvious code sections.

For HTML, use <!-- comment --> to explain structural decisions or complex sections.

For CSS, use /* comment */ for sectioning and explaining non-obvious styles.

Good Example (JavaScript JSDoc):

/**
 * Calculates the total price of items in a shopping cart.
 * @param {Array<Object>} items - An array of item objects, each with 'price' and 'quantity' properties.
 * @returns {number} The total calculated price.
 */
function calculateTotalPrice(items) {
  let total = 0;
  for (const item of items) {
    total += item.price * item.quantity;
  }
  return total;
}

Bad Example (JavaScript - Missing JSDoc, unclear):

function calc(arr) { // What does arr contain? What does it return?
  let t = 0;
  for (const i of arr) {
    t += i.p * i.q; // Unclear property names
  }
  return t;
}

6. Issue Reporting

Releases are managed by maintainers through our CI/CD pipeline (.github/workflows/main.yml).

9. Multilingual Contributions
Our website supports multiple languages (en/, lo/, th/, fr/). When contributing content or features that impact localized sections, please adhere to these guidelines:

Content Synchronization: New content or updates to existing content (e.g., articles, service descriptions) must be synchronized across all relevant language directories.

Translation Quality:

For non-English content, prioritize professional translation or review by a native speaker.

Ensure cultural adaptation beyond literal translation (e.g., business practices for lo/).

Validate Unicode support and correct text direction for scripts like Lao and Thai.

Translation Workflow:

Propose new content in English (en/) first.

Once approved, submit translations for lo/, th/, or fr/.

Consider using tools like DeepL or engaging a professional translator for accuracy.

SEO Considerations:

Ensure sitemap.xml is updated to include all new localized URLs.

Verify correct hreflang tags on relevant pages to signal language and regional targeting to search engines.
